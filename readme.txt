1.
	In phpMyAdmin
	Create a database called my_database
	Create a table called data
	Make the attributes id and name.
		I made the id auto increment 

2. 
	Make a directory called 'project3330'.
	This will be a different for you guys because I put it inside
	Applications/MAMP/htdocs
	htdocs is the folder to put project3330 in
	the path should look like MAMP/htdocs/project3330/index.html etc 

3.	
	Username: root
	password should be: root

4.
	Start servers
	Type in browser localhost:8888/project3330/ or localhost:8888/project3330/index.html


ADDITION:

- Please import the 'library.sql' file into phpMyAdmin as a new database named 'Library'.
